And some diseases the patients have like:

# Questions
In my Investigation of this dataset I will try to check and answer all the questions related to the effect of these features on showing up or not.

# Findings
- Age doesn't affect No-show as much, but it appears that kids and elders are more likely to show on the appointment.
- Gender does not have any effect, but I found that more females are going to this appointment than males.
- etc.
